# Adblock Fast

## App information

**App title:** Adblock Fast

**Description:**

You can now block ads without rooting your device or switching browsers.

Adblock Fast runs optimized filtering rules to accelerate webpages more but consume less CPU,
memory, and storage than other ad blockers do. Also unlike other ad blockers, Adblock Fast doesn’t
allow “acceptable ads” and never will.

The app requires and blocks ads in Samsung Internet 4.0 and up. After installing, follow the in-app
directions to turn blocking on.

Adblock Fast is free to use and the source code free to modify:
